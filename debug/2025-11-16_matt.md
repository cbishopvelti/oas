Ok, I've have fixed that issue.

Basically auth has 2 cookies, the session cookie and the remember me cookie. If the session cookie expires, then the remember me cookie is checked. The remember me cookie wasn't available accrosss all domains *in some browsers*.

You might need to logout and log in again to reset that cookie.
